# 🚨 Xcode Error Fix Guide

## ❌ **Error Found**
```
Provisioning profile "iOS Team Provisioning Profile: in.skykraft.SkyKraftUserApp" 
doesn't include the currently selected device "Omee's MacBook Pro" 
(identifier 00006000-001249820AD8801E).
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
- **Problem**: Xcode is trying to build for your Mac instead of iOS devices
- **Issue**: Wrong target device selected
- **Impact**: Cannot archive for App Store submission

## 🛠️ **Quick Fix (5 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Fix Target Device in Xcode**
1. **In Xcode** (which should be open)
2. **Look at the top toolbar** (next to play/stop buttons)
3. **Click the device selector dropdown**
4. **Select "Any iOS Device (arm64)"** ← **CRITICAL**
5. **NOT** "My Mac" or any simulator

### **Step 2: Verify Selection**
- ✅ **Correct**: "Any iOS Device (arm64)"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "My Mac" or "Omee's MacBook Pro"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Any simulator devices

### **Step 3: Clean and Build**
1. **Product** → **Clean Build Folder**
2. **Product** → **Build**

## 🎯 **Visual Guide**

```
Xcode Toolbar:
[▶️] [⏹️] [📱 Any iOS Device (arm64)] ← Select This
```

## 🚀 **After Fix - Deploy to App Store**

### **Archive the App**
1. **Product** → **Archive**
2. Wait for archiving to complete
3. **Xcode Organizer** will open automatically

### **Upload to App Store**
1. Select your archive
2. Click **"Distribute App"**
3. Choose **"App Store Connect"**
4. Follow the upload process

## ⚠️ **Additional Warnings (Non-Critical)**

These warnings won't prevent deployment:
- **Deployment Target**: Some pods have older iOS targets (10.0, 11.0)
- **Script Phases**: Build script warnings
- **These are normal and can be ignored**

## 🔧 **Alternative Fix (If Above Doesn't Work)**

### **Reset Xcode Project**
```bash
# In terminal
cd ios
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
pod install
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### **Reopen Xcode**
```bash
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

## 📱 **Expected Result**

After fixing the target device:
- ✅ Build succeeds without provisioning profile errors
- ✅ Can archive for App Store submission
- ✅ Ready to upload to App Store Connect

## 🆘 **Still Having Issues?**

1. **Check Team Selection**: Ensure your Apple Developer team is selected
2. **Verify Bundle ID**: Make sure it's unique
3. **Check Signing**: Ensure "Automatically manage signing" is enabled
4. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes a fresh start helps
